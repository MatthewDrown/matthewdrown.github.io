        Note: <br>
        I have been busily working on Memento for the last week in preparation for the December edition to be released.
        As a result, I have not had time to complete this blog post. Please return on Sunday, 8 January to read the completed post.

        The decision to create this blog was made during a passing conversation with my brother.
        He remarked that he was impressed by my love of mathematics and suggested I ought to share this passion more broadly, noting also my eagerness to discuss that which I am interested in with those around me.
        I had recently enjoyed recounting my months through <a href="https://portal.mementopublications.com/" target="_blank">Memento</a> and was inspired to maintain a blog throughout my postgraduate studies.
        I will write frequently about the mathematics I am studying and researching at the time but also intend to cover topics outside of academia that interest me.

        I commence my postgraduate studies on Friday, 6 January.
        The Master of Philosophy (MPhil) in mathematical sciences requires that students complete five courses on mathematics topics.
        Each year the school offers four pure mathematics courses whose topics vary from year to year.
        This year I will be studying three pure mathematics courses, namely:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Differential Geometry,</li>
        <li>Algebraic Topology,</li>
        <li>Category Theory.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It should of course then be expected that these will each receive moderate attention in this blog throughout the year.
      </p>

        My project is entitled 'Classifying Spaces and Simplicial Groupoids'.
        Due to its long and rich history, pure mathematics is a remarkably well-developed field of study; so much so that it seems undergraduate degrees seldom equip students with the tools necessary to even choose an area of research.
        Coupled with the abstract nature of the field, this means commencing research students typically choose a supervisor who provides an appropriate research topic.
        In the second semester of 2022 I met with each of the pure mathematicians at the University of Adelaide to gauge what an MPhil with them would entail.
        The principal focus of pure mathematicians at the University of Adelaide is differential geometry so naturally most of the potential projects were based in this field.
        I elected to study a different field, opting for the available project that lay at the intersection of category theory and homotopy theory.
