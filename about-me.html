				I am a postgraduate pure mathematics student at the University of Adelaide currently pursuing a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) under the supervision of <a href="https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/daniel.stevenson" target="_blank">Dr Daniel Stevenson</a>. My research lies at the intersection of category theory and homotopy theory. <br>
				I obtained my undergraduate degree—a Bachelor of Mathematical and Computer Sciences (Pure Mathematics)—from the University of Adelaide in 2022, graduating with a perfect GPA of 7.0. <br>
				I intend to continue my postgraduate studies by undertaking a PhD in pure mathematics following the completion of my MPhil and hope to become a researching academic.
